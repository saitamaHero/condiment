I think naming a library "condiment" by merging "condition" and "statement" is a clever and playful choice, but it also presents some potential for confusion. Here's why:

### Pros:
1. **Memorable and Fun**: The name is catchy and memorable, which is great for branding. "Condiment" immediately evokes the idea of something that enhances or adds flavor—much like how conditions and statements enhance the logic of a program. The analogy could be fun and relatable for developers.
   
2. **Creative**: It shows creativity, which could make it stand out in a sea of more conventional library names. The idea of mixing two concepts in such a way (condition and statement) is novel and could be intriguing for developers browsing for libraries.

3. **Intrigue**: A unique name like "condiment" might spark curiosity. Developers might want to investigate what the library does just because of the odd but intriguing name.

### Cons:
1. **Lack of Immediate Clarity**: While the word "condiment" is clever, it doesn't immediately communicate what the library does. For example, a developer looking for a condition-related or statement-related library might not make the connection between "condiment" and the concept of conditionals or flow control. You might need good documentation to explain the metaphor clearly.
   
2. **Possible Ambiguity**: "Condiment" is also the name of food toppings (ketchup, mustard, etc.), which might cause some confusion for developers. If they aren't familiar with the library, they might think it's something related to food, or they might expect a more humorous or trivial library. This could affect how seriously the library is taken, depending on the context.

3. **SEO/Discoverability**: When developers search for libraries related to conditions or statements, they might not immediately find "condiment," unless it’s well-tagged or indexed. Using more direct naming (like "ConditionalStatements" or "LogicFlow") could improve searchability.

### Balancing the Name:
- If your library has a strong branding and documentation effort to explain why it's named "condiment," it could work well. A bit of humor can go a long way if the community enjoys it.
- You might consider adding a short tagline or description alongside the library name, like "Condiment: Enhancing conditional logic" or something that immediately tells the user its purpose.

In the end, if the library does what it promises and the name sticks in the community, developers will likely remember it and appreciate the creativity. If the name creates confusion, it might be worth reconsidering or explaining the naming choice in more depth.
